Building
----------------

To build this, you need a fairly recent build of Xcode, as well as an up-to-date version of Xcode's command-line utilities (downloadable in Xcode's preferences). You'll also need Cocoapods, which you can install from the command line:

    sudo gem install cocoapods

Once that's finished, clone the repository and open the directory with the source code in it. Run the following command:

    pod install

This will install the external libraries that we depend on.
